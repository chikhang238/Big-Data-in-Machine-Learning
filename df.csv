right now, it doesn't look like there's an effective treatment, so everything has to do with prevention.\xa0 the virus gets in through the eyes, nose and mouth, so you have to keep your hands away from your face, and you've got to do hand washing in a very fastidious way. cbc explainswhat we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreak do we know why the elderly are more at risk? no. in terms of speculation, it presumably has something to do with the immune system in some way. yet at the same time, children, who often will be at risk for things that older people are at risk of, appear not to be at the same level of risk.\xa0 what we do know is about 10 to 15 per cent of people who develop mild cases go on to get severe cases. that seems to be higher in nursing homes, where, for the most part, they're frailer than older people who are not there. so everyone needs to take care, but we particularly need to take care with older people who are frail, who have got a lot of illnesses, who are in and out of the hospital, who are in long-term care. do you know if enough is being done in nova scotia to make sure ill people are not going into nursing homes? i can't comment on that. generally, though, i expect the desire to want to go see someone would need to be really carefully balanced against the risk that we pose to them and other people.\xa0 some of the discussion that's going on is about using teleconferencing and such as a way to interact. not quite as satisfactory, but clearly much less risky. amid coronavirus fears, n.s. pharmacist says soap and water is better than hand sanitizer we know that covid-19 seems to be marching ahead, and we're not even really sure where it is and how far it's spread yet because some places don't really have adequate testing. as a doctor who deals with the elderly, what goes through your mind as you contemplate this disease? a few things come to mind. one is how very dependent we are on science, and particularly the science out of the u.s., because they're the people who have the resources and the attitude to see this as a fixable problem that they want to be at the centre of.\xa0 right now, the development of the vaccine, which appears to be quite a ways off, seems to be our best bet.\xa0 and it's likely, too, that one thing they'll have to figure out is who gets sick and when, so we're not overwhelmed by a very large number of people who are ill all showing up at the same time.\xa0 so i'm concerned about this because it seems to me that this could be a very substantial challenge to the way we provide health care with the resources that we have at present. videoappointments needed to access nova scotia covid-19 assessment sites you mentioned looking to the u.s. for some guidance in this outbreak, but there has been a fair bit of criticism in the way the centers for disease control and prevention in the u.s. has failed to respond adequately or quickly enough. do you think canada has done a better job? some independent observations may suggest canada has done a good job with the resources that we have. but obviously\xa0the scale that's needed is going to be a scale the u.s. can provide. they have a much larger infrastructure and they have some large volumes of labs who are very excellent at this. presumably, canada can be part of a worldwide co-ordinated effort, but it's at times like this where i think we need to understand how very much dependent we are on the state of science in the united states. it's easy sometimes to make fun of what goes on in the u.s., but this, i think, really exposes how very much we depend on american scientists. what it's like for nova scotians in countries hardest hit by coronavirus so if someone does have a senior citizen in the family and this person's health is not great, what can they do to keep them safe? we've got to be really meticulous about visiting and about being sure that anyone who goes in employs good handwashing techniques. it's not like this is going to go away any time soon, by all of the estimates, so this is something we're going to have to really take seriously and adapt to.\xa0 and if there's one thing that societies have shown they can do, it's adapt to large challenges. we've just got to make sure that we're up to it as well. more top stories videonova scotia tourism businesses fear major hit over covid-19videotight rental market has dartmouth renters worried over looming 'renoviction'halifax regional police investigate suspicious firebusiness groups wary of calls for paid sick day laws as covid-19 loomsnew brunswick records 1st 'presumptive' case of covid-19"", 'covid-19 concerns, closures have families and communities heading out on the land the combination of health concerns and closures is leading many families, individuals and communities out on the land, to do things like harvest medicines.

do people get charged interest if they defer? a: the big banks and other lenders are potentially offering this on a case by case basis. i really should stress that if you're still working or if you have savings, it's best to not contact the lenders right now because they're absolutely flooded with calls and service times are super slow.\xa0 but what will happen is, if you are granted a deferral, the payment is deferred. the interest that you would have otherwise paid is added to the mortgage. and yes, you would ultimately pay interest on interest. q: who might qualify for this? if you've lost your job or you're in self-isolation and income is disrupted, you likely qualify. lenders understand that people are going through difficult times and they're going to be flexible. they have family as well. their family may have lost jobs, so they're going to do what they can to help to keep people in homes. q: if somebody has savings, would it be best to just keep paying mortgage payments rather than create a bigger problem down the road? a: yeah. for starters, you'll save money. but the other thing to keep in mind is we basically want to flatten the curve on the calls to the lenders, much like flattening the curve to the hospital system. right now, lenders are adding hundreds of phone lines and they still cannot keep up with the volume of calls they're getting. where there might have been a 24-hour turnaround before, now it's three to five days. so if you've contacted your lender and you haven't heard back yet, they haven't forgotten about you. just be patient; they'll get to you. q: do you expect all the banks to handle this the same way? a: i would imagine that every lender will have their own policies. when you contact them, explain the situation. and as i said before, they will do whatever they can to help people. you're not guaranteed a full six-month deferral, nor do you have to take six months if you are granted a deferral. it is not payment forgiveness. you will ultimately end up having to pay the money back down the road. q: not everybody has savings, so are there other things people could do instead of deferring\xa0payments for months?

a: it shouldn't. lenders know what is going on, obviously. if you are granted a deferral, get an email from your lender saying that was the case. no system is perfect, so it's possible that errors could report on the credit bureau and you'll want that backup information to prove that. but they will not intentionally lower your credit because you've had a deferred payment. q: will this be available to landlords, who could potentially pass it along to their renters?

(cbc news) even within your home, avoid other people. if you have the space, isolate yourself in the house: rooms that are for you, and rooms that are for everyone else. stick to your own bathroom and your own bedroom. if it is not possible for you to have your own space, clean the spaces you do use regularly to reduce the possibility of spreading any virus to the people you live with. you can possibly develop the disease with mild symptoms or none at all, and still give it to other people. the people you spread it to, and the people they potentially spread it to, may develop a more dangerous form of the disease. since you can't know if you have the disease, act as if you do. stay at home to avoid spreading it in the community. covid-19: what you need to know what are the symptoms of covid-19? common symptoms include:  fever. cough. tiredness.  but more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, which can lead to death. health canada has built a self-assessment tool. what should i do if i feel sick? isolate yourself and call 811. do not visit an emergency room or urgent care centre to get tested. a health professional at 811 will give you advice and instructions. how can i protect myself?   wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.   avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.   clean regularly touched surfaces regularly.   practise physical distancing.   more detailed information on the outbreak is available on the\xa0federal government's website. more from cbc p.e.i. videop.e.i. chief public health officer stressing self-isolation, social distancingi live here nowopera singer victor cal y mayor found just what he was looking for on p.e.i."", 'icbc allowing drivers to put off payments for 90 days, renew licences by phone the auto insurer is making the changes in response to the growing covid-19 crisis ""icbc is allowing customers hard-hit by the covid-19 crisis to delay making payments for up to 90 days with no penalty. the auto insurer also says drivers needing to renew their licences, change their addresses, or acquire driving records can now do so from home. according to a release, the 90-day payment deferrals were put in place """"to\xa0support those facing financial hardship at this time"""" and are available to customers\xa0on autoplan payment plans. previously', ""from shopping to walks: your coronavirus questions answered as the number of cases continues to grow and sanctions intended to curb social interactions escalate, many albertans are wondering how best to protect themselves. from shuttered businesses and empty offices to silent streets and crashing stock markets, the covid-19 pandemic has dramatically altered\xa0every aspect of daily life in alberta. as the number of cases continues to grow and sanctions intended to curb social interactions escalate, many albertans are\xa0wondering how best to protect themselves, and which every-day activities are still considered safe. dr. mark joffe joined edmonton am on monday to answer some of those questions.\xa0 joffe is the vice-president and medical director for northern alberta at alberta health services. he is also a professor in the department of medicine at the university of alberta, where he's also an adjunct professor in medical microbiology and immunology and the school of public health. here is that conversation, edited for clarity and length. q. is it still ok to go to recreational areas like the river valley trails that could be crowded? a. i was out walking\xa0in the river valley this weekend. i was actually quite impressed that most people, as they came toward me on the path, seemed to understand that they\xa0needed to remain about six feet away from me and i was certainly doing the same with them. it's great being out in the fresh air and especially if there's a little bit of wind blowing that would dilute any virus that might be in the air, that would be the safest you could possibly be. i am self-isolating and only going out to walk my dog. will i be able to continue if a quarantine is called?\xa0 we're going to\xa0have to look after our animals. they're part of our families. we can't ignore them. and i can't really imagine that we'll reach a point of quarantine where we won't be able to take our animals out for a walk to do their business. i hope we don't reach that point. being out in the great outdoors is actually the safest place to be as long as you're six feet away from others walking outside. it couldn't be any safer than that.\xa0 new testing protocols give priority to at-risk populations. why was this change needed now? dr. mark joffe is the vice president\xa0and medical director for northern alberta at alberta health services.   (cbc) we knew that, over time, we would have to look very carefully at our test strategies and that things would evolve. to date, the focus to date has been on returning travelers. we knew over time the number of travelers would gradually drop off as borders closed and as canadians returned home. we also knew that as the number of individuals impacted by covid-19 increased in our communities that we would have to refocus our attention. again the key thing is, individuals who get sick need to stay home. we don't need a test to tell people to stay home. we will be focusing our testing more on vulnerable populations, particularly those in senior centres. we're going to be focusing the testing more on essential service workers, particularly health care workers. it will be really important for us to know whether a healthcare worker with a mild fever or a cough\xa0has covid-19 or not. and if they do not have it, we're going to want to get them back into the workforce as soon as their symptoms settle. my 74-year-old husband has a severe lung disease. is it safe for me to do our shopping or should i rely on the help of my neighbours?\xa0 i would say that an individual who has serious underlying lung disease and is in their 70s is exactly this sort of individual that we want to protect from covid-19. \xa0 i understand that your caller prefers to do her own shopping and wants to be out in public. she can certainly do so safely, if she maintains social distancing, cleans her hands frequently and clean surfaces frequently. she can go out and can do some of her household chores safely if she's really attentive to detail. but i think this is a time that it would be reasonable to accept some help from others as well. if i go out shopping, is it safe to bring the items inside my home immediately? i think it's certainly safe to bring things immediately inside if you wanted to. but you can take some extra precautions with articles that may come in packaging.\xa0 for example, if you buy 12 rolls of toilet paper in wrapping, you could take the wrapping off outside and bring the individual rolls inside. any contamination would be on the outside surface. there may be surfaces that you could wipe down with a common household cleaner or disinfectant. with cardboard boxes in general, it's a good idea to remove the items from the box and then bring any smaller items inside. what should people who are continuing to work in an office be doing to take extra precautions? it's about the attention to detail and focusing on activities that we probably wouldn't have thought much of before. it's about social distancing, staying two meters away from others as much as possible. it's about frequent hand cleaning. and if one is working in a cubicle-type environment, use cleaners or disinfectants to clean the high-touch surfaces frequently. it's certainly possible to continue to go to work in that kind of an environment but it's really about the attention to detail. many of the symptoms\xa0are similar to a flu or the common cold. at what point should i be concerned?\xa0\xa0 by far the most common symptom with covid-19 is fever and just about everyone that develops covid-19 will have a fever. sometimes it's not present right at the beginning but it will occur within the first day or two. that's the most common thing. cough is the second most common. and so again it's that combination of a fever and a cough. that should make individuals most concerned.\xa0 there definitely are some other things that can occasionally be seen. muscle aches and pains and fatigue are fairly common as well. it's that combination of symptoms, the onset of a fever with a cough that would be the most concerning. how airborne is the virus?\xa0 what we know about this virus is that it's spread in relatively large droplets that emerge from the mouth as people talk or particularly if they cough or sneeze those large droplets tend to settle out over about three feet possibly out to as much as six feet. that's why we talk about social distancing. the virus is not airborne. it does not spread long distances through the air. what about air temperature? how does that impact transmission? i don't think we fully understand this yet. we certainly know with some viruses\xa0they actually tend to prefer cold weather and low humidity, and as the temperature rises or the humidity rises, they may not survive as long in the environment.\xa0  covid-19 cases in alberta have more than tripled in past week federal government warns of covid-19 enforcement measures alberta changes covid-19 testing protocols to focus on individuals who are most at risk "", 'no privacy review completed of controversial telus health babylon app a privacy impact assessment of babylon, the controversial telehealth doctor consultation app, may not be completed for a year or more.

[heather] morrison, from my perspective — that although the majority of islanders understand how serious this situation is, and how we need to act appropriately, that we were hearing far too many islanders don't think that this is for them. and we needed to take the measures that are provided under the public health act to make sure islanders know how serious this is and that we have the ability to hit them where it hurts the most. q:\xa0 and that's in the pocketbook. how do you enforce this? dr. morrison has been working closely with our police agencies to let them know what was coming and what is expected of them. as she has been saying and as we continue to say, mitch, our first desire would be not to fine people. i think we want people to realize that as islanders we want to do what we can for everybody. that's always what we do, and the best thing everybody can do right now is to stay home unless they really, really need to be out for an essential service. q: why do you think people aren't getting the message? i have to be honest, i think that some of these terms are so new to people that we're all trying to understand what they mean. i think that that's a certain part of it. i probably think that people read certain things on social media or other media outlets, who might try to be downplaying the severity of this. all the best medical minds in the world are telling us to do this. there's a certain part to human nature here where people don't like to follow direction. q: you set up a line as well where people can call. people have been flooding other lines such as 911, which we did not want to do. what we've been hearing on these lines has been, so and so was away for two weeks and they came home and they go to the grocery store and they're not self-isolating. so we will be passing that information along to the police authorities and making sure that message is delivered and people recognize that this isn't a choice. these are directives coming from the chief public health officer and we need them to be heeded and taken as seriously as they're intended. q: you talked with the prime minister last night as well. he's upset with us all, it seems. everybody on the call, my fellow premiers and the prime minister, we're all dealing with these same issues. most locations have taken or will take a similar approach here. and it just comes back to that we need everybody to understand how serious this is. and if we are intended to get through this with the least amount of impact and the least amount of severity as possible, that we need to follow the social distancing and follow the self-isolation directives that are coming from our public health officers. q: and if ottawa does introduce the emergencies act what does that do to your powers as a premier? we had a great discussion about that last night with the prime minister and each jurisdiction was asking some questions. the teeth that's now in our public health act — that previous governments had put in following sars, from h1n1, and i give full credit to former premier ghiz for doing this — our public health act is strong. we have a lot of powers, as we announced there last night. and so nobody has been calling for a national intervention here yet and that's what we articulated to the prime minister. but if such a thing were to happen they would only want to do that so they could help pool and disperse resources as need be. and so there's a bigger discussion that needs to be held with all premiers on that. but as of last night the prime minister was just trying to figure out and engage the interest and desire of all jurisdictions. q: what are police agencies on p.e.i. telling you about the possibility of having to come in contact with somebody who's got symptoms of covid? police agencies would be like our frontline health care workers. they are built for this. they understand the risks. we will have further conversations on whether you know some protective equipment is required in that regard. a lot of this will be done from a safe social distance. it's a concern. mitch, the police, like the rest of us, this is new ground for all of us. we're learning this on the fly. there's no playbook here. perhaps we're writing a bit of a playbook in this regard, but we will deal with this on a day-by-day basis, and if issues continue to arise, or things that we weren't prepared for, we're going to try to deal with them. q: some of the public unions on p.e.i. say we're not sure we have all the equipment we need to deal with this. what about the police agencies? are they geared up? that's a good question, as i say, and i think that's what we will find out as we roll forward. the indication we've been getting back from the police has been it's business as usual. they know their job. they're prepared to do it. the province is enacting a directive here under the public health act, and they're prepared to respond. q: what worries you most these days? many things worry me. number one, we have to get this health crisis taken as seriously as we can so our containment and mitigation efforts can be as successful as possible. i worry about the economy. i worry about the immediate [impact], but also how long this goes and what the recovery process is. i worry about the social impacts on our citizens who are so used to being social butterflies as islanders who now don't have that interaction. i have lots of things that i worry about but i also feel we have a really, really good team and we're building a strong plan to help us get through this. but these are difficult days and i worry 24/7. q: did the prime minister give you any indication of how quickly the money will start to flow? i thought the call last night with the prime minister was a really, really good call. money is going to start to roll quickly within the week which is very, very important to us. and we've been saying what makes or breaks us is how quickly money gets out. two things that we've been lobbying and fighting for here, which is there will be no federal clawback of money if we put it in the hands of islanders through ei, so that was a big win for p.e.i. we've been pushing hard for that. they are putting in place a benefit, which people who don't have ei or haven't qualified for ei, will be able to access ei until their seasonal job kicks in. so those are two things we've been fighting really hard for and will make our recovery a lot easier. more from cbc p.e.i. island real estate agents work to adapt to a changing market amid covid-19i live here nowopera singer victor cal y mayor found just what he was looking for on p.e.i."", 'swabs used for covid-19 testing are in short supply in london there\'s a shortage of swabs used for covid-19 tests in the middlesex-london health unit, but health officials believe it\'s only a temporary problem.

a doctor answers your covid-19 questions dr. allison mcgeer, an infectious diseases specialist answers questions about when to practice social distancing, covid-19 infections, and possible transmission routes. as the covid-19 pandemic continues to change nearly every aspect of life in toronto, many still have questions about the virus and the risk it poses. dr. allison mcgeer, an infectious diseases specialist at toronto's mount sinai hospital who worked on the front lines of the sars epidemic in 2003, took your questions on cbc radio's metro morning on wednesday.\xa0 q: is it possible to be a carrier of the virus without being sick? and if so, how would the person know they're a carrier and what should they do? a: probably not. there is some evidence that people can get infected with this virus and not show any symptoms. those people probably don't carry it for any length of time. their immune system will respond to it and they'll get rid of it. the evidence so far is that those people are less likely to spread the virus than people who are sick.\xa0 part of the reason for all of this social distancing and keeping away from people is there is a possibility that you could have this and not know it. it won't harm you in that circumstance. there is a possibility you could pass it on to other people.\xa0 q: once you get covid-19 and recover, can you get it again?\xa0 a: we don't know the answer to that question yet. we're only two and a half months into the outbreak with this virus. we've never seen it before so we're not going to know for sure until we've had enough people who have been exposed. i think there's good reason to hope that if you've had it once, you'll be protected at least for a few months or a couple of years, but we don't know that. it's a very unusual infection after you recover from it, you are not protected for some period of time. we don't know that absolutely yet. this is different from something like ebola where we know once you've recovered from ebola virus infection that you're going to be immune. canada, u.s. border temporarily closing to non-essential traffic to slow covid-19 q: is there a possibility of covid-19 being a recurring annual flu? we get the flu every year as opposed to sars which didn't come back.\xa0 a: we don't know. if it is a recurring illness, it will likely be milder in subsequent years. it's just like flu pandemics. when it first comes and nobody has been exposed to it before, you get a more severe illness. if you get recurrent infections, generally it's not as bad. so if this is a virus that causes recurrent infections, it'll probably settle into being a seasonal problem like influenza. and of course, if we have vaccine then things will be much better. but again, we do not yet know the answer to that. q: i'm a 70-year old healthy adult, and i live on the 24th floor of an apartment building. i hear that i'm not supposed to go outside but i'm just wondering if that would mean i shouldn't go on the elevator in the lobby in my building and go for a walk. a: i think each of us needs to do what we have to do to get by and not going out and not going for a walk is something that you might be able to keep up for a couple of days. the goal here is not that you stay inside. the goal here is that you stay away from other people. there is nothing wrong with going outside at all as long you're staying away from other people.\xa0 when you live on the 24th floor, that means if you take the elevator down, there's likely to be other people in the elevator. this is a balancing act. for those of us who are over 65, getting out and moving and getting exercise is very important. so i think you just maybe want to limit how often you do that and try to travel at times when there's not going to be so many other people on the elevator. health minister says test result wait times 'not acceptable' as ontario confirms 25 new covid-19 caseshow gta health centres are trying to protect moms, newborns from covid-19 q: people have also been asking about when they live in condos and apartment buildings about ventilation. is there any risk around the vents?\xa0 a: as far as we know this is not transmitted over long distances in the air, so there's no reason to worry about airflow in your house or your apartment building or your condo. q: why are we not just protecting the most vulnerable people and allowing everyone else to continue with life? why are we closing borders and asking everybody to socially distance? a: we're not doing that at the moment because although this disease is much less severe in younger people, it still can be very severe. this is disproportionately more dangerous for older and more vulnerable people.\xa0 there are still lots of younger people in italy and around and in china who have died. the challenge is that there's a lot more younger people. although the proportion of people who are going to die who are younger is smaller, the number of young people who are going to die from this infection if we don't control it is still going to be a very large number.\xa0 q: i'm a nurse working in the community. is it a good idea to isolate nurses, doctors and health care professionals in hotels so instead of putting our families and patients at risk, we keep ourselves isolated in a hotel. we can then go to work and come back to the hotel on a regular basis until everything settles down. a: as long as people don't have symptoms, the chances that they'll pass it onto other people is either zero or very small. with healthcare workers, we are focused on making sure that they are not coming to work and if they have any illness that they get tested immediately.\xa0 healthcare workers in the hospital are using precautions all the time to protect themselves. based on data we have so far from hong kong, as long as we're using those precautions, health care workers are not at substantial risk. so we're not worried about healthcare workers going home and infecting other people at home or infecting people in the community. we want to maintain things as normal as possible for people. so i think that's why public health has not yet imposed any other restrictions on health care workers. q: i have some family members who work in factories. factories have hundreds if not thousands of people and they've stayed open. is it a safe idea to go to work with people in close proximity in line and touching the same parts as other people? a: it's important for every workplace and for workers to think about what they can do to protect themselves. so i would hope people would have instructions about washing their hands, alcohol hand rub, and that people would be talking about whether they need to do extra cleaning and space people further apart.\xa0 we're trying very hard to slow the spread of this virus while doing as little damage to our lives as possible. but we're not doing a little damage; we're doing a lot of damage to a lot of people's lives. the province and the country are still trying to find the right balance with the least amount of damage. some services are essential and some things we need to keep going. we need to look at the situation and say how do we make this as safe as possible."", 'how quebecers are coming together despite social distancing measures some of the offers are small\xa0— a note posted to the entrance of an apartment building\xa0— and some are bigger\xa0— like facebook groups that garnered thousands of users within hours to organize picking\xa0up groceries or medications for those most at-risk.

(aly song/reuters) there have been these strange one-off cases that i\'ve read about where, for instance, a yorkie caught tuberculosis from a human years ago\xa0— it was a documented case. but these are these kinds of things were unusual. one thing people need to be aware of is mrsa\xa0which is a staph bacteria, the superbug that we\'ve often heard about. i used to take my dog to do volunteer work at the hospital and i would put socks on her because then she comes home and jumps on my bed. that is something that dogs can actually give to humans. mrsa is one of the big ones that we\'ve often heard about. we hear of diseases like bird flu and swine flu. did they come from animals originally? indeed, yes they did. hiv, ebola, flu and malaria — these all come from animals. malaria comes from mosquitoes. this is exactly where they come from. influenza is a zoonotic source. we like to be affectionate with our pets. we even cuddle them — our dogs and cats in particular. does that pose a health risk? i don\'t want to be the bearer of bad news, but it could. the question is: where has your dog been? and where has your dog\'s mouth been? one thing about cats is that they can shed toxoplasmosis. for people who are immunosuppressed, that can be serious. somebody, for instance, who is going through chemotherapy, who is sick, even pregnant women are considered to be at risk for toxoplasmosis. so we probably should be very careful if you\'re around cats and you fall into one of these risk categories. what about allowing your dog or your cat to lick you? let\'s deal with cats first. i have read that many people who are not animal lovers would probably be mortified. we can pick things up from our animals, depending on where their mouth has been. some dogs have the absolutely disgusting habit of eating\xa0cat excrement\xa0so it is possible that a dog\'s mouth could be in contact with something like toxoplasmosis and we don\'t want that to spread. what about the idea that a dog\'s mouth is the cleanest thing you could possibly imagine?\xa0is there any truth to that? i would really take a bottle of hand sanitizer over a dog\'s mouth. it depends where your dog\'s mouth has been. let\'s be realistic. if your dog has has just eaten a can of tuna fish, i don\'t want her licking my face. so it depends where your dog\'s mouth has been. we have to consider that\'s probably more of a saying than an accuracy. dogs wearing masks are seen in a stroller in shanghai on february 19, 2020. (noel celis/afp/getty images) we have a very strong immune system. i think if somebody were really concerned about their immune system, that might be something that we should avoid. but the reality is most of our big scary diseases have come from animals — not dogs, but certainly, monkeys and chimps have been responsible for some of these these big ones that are scary. do animals generally like being pet and hugged by humans, or is it something they just tolerate? there\'s something called a consent test that is common for schools and educators now to teach children about dogs. pet your dog, stop petting your dog and see what your dog does. does your dog want to be pet?\xa0many dogs will start pawing or leaning in because they want to be pet. this, by the way, is a way of teaching children there\'s times when you don\'t want to be touched and there\'s times that your dog doesn\'t want to be touched. so a consent test is a way of asking your dog if they\'re in the mood to be pet right now. many dogs are, and then they\'ll just sort of get up and walk away when they\'re done. so we can ask our pets if they\'re in the mood to be pet. would you say that pets are really beneficial in terms of mental health? there has recently been some literature that is exploring this very question. one of the problems in anthrozoological literature is that we have not been diligent about doing scientific research, especially with the explosion of this research area. a lot of it is anecdotal which begs for further research. a dog wearing face mask is seen on a street as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in shanghai, china march 2, 2020.  (aly song/reuters) i have a colleague who\'s actually been investigating whether or not pets improve people\'s depressive moods. while most people, anecdotally, say absolutely, the researchers is exploring this more and more and it\'s saying that it may not be that clear cut. i think some of the contributing factors are a sense of worry or anxiety when we have an animal to take care of. that\'s currently under scientific investigation. anecdotally, i would say that if you ask people, they would say absolutely. in my own experience, i have gotten through a lot of things because of my stormy cat when i was a child and my current dog. i think most people would say \'without a doubt\' their pet brings them a lot of emotional satisfaction and greater mental health. answers have been edited for length and clarity. listen to the full interview below: on this edition of """"talking animals', 'nova scotia hotel chain says occupancy down 90% because of covid-19 occupancy is down about 90 per cent at a nova scotia hotel chain, and is transforming how staff carry out their day-to-day duties.

(paul chiasson/the canadian press) one more thing i think the government is doing well is the decision that for people in long-term care facilities, if someone has been outside the country, they cannot visit them for two weeks. that was a wise move to take, as well as what the nova scotia health authority is doing in limiting visits to all the facilities throughout the provinces. where can nova scotia improve? from what the chief medical officer of health was saying, we still don't have the means to have final [testing] validation in nova scotia. it needs to be sent off to the federal lab in winnipeg to get confirmation. and that obviously causes delays. on the other hand, if people take self-isolation very seriously, then at least they are taking those steps right away upon having been tested. so the delay is not quite as critical as otherwise. q&aa geriatrician talks about the covid-19 pandemic and what it means for seniors i'm also interested that the education minister had said that\xa0the public schools will not be closed down after march break. i think that that may be the wrong message to be sending to people. at a minimum, there should be a message that travel is discouraged. premier stephen mcneil said any students that travelled internationally would have to self-quarantine for 14 days as well. do you think that helps, or does it not go far enough? i think it will help. does it go far enough? we don't know yet. this is such a fast-developing situation, and we are all struggling a bit to come to terms with what is the best action to take. what about the federal government's measures? there is a principle in pandemic planning called reciprocity. what this means is that if the government is limiting people's liberty — like asking them to self-quarantine — they have, in turn, an obligation to provide resources for the person to not be seriously disadvantaged by it, or at least to reduce the disadvantage. a nurse holds a coronavirus testing kit at a wolverhampton, england, testing site. health policy expert elaine gibson says widespread testing for the coronavirus has proven to be effective at combatting covid-19.  (christopher furlong/getty images) so i am very pleased to see the government announce changes to employment insurance to make people eligible right away if they are under quarantine or isolation, and also the amount they are giving to research. but what happens also is that we know covid-19 hits much harder for people who have other illnesses. if they start with a lower health status, there is an obligation to ensure measures that support those people who are more likely to get hit hard. myths, germs and soap-vs-sanitizer: things you ought to know about coronavirus indigenous communities were specifically mentioned, and i'm so pleased with that because they start with a lower health status and, presumably, are going to get enhanced support through that. but i have not heard yet, other than the mention of indigenous community support, about measures they are taking to best protect those who are less well-off in society. what about the idea of closing our borders? i'm of two minds about this because part of the international health regulations' idea was that you not have the economies crippled by borders shut down. and if the disease is going to spread anyway, then i'm just not sure that locking down the borders for people from certain countries is the way to go as opposed to\xa0self-isolation. what else can be done? health-care workers are our heroes in times of pandemic, and they need full support. something that i would like to see either the federal or provincial governments to take on is providing emergency daycare for the children of the health-care workers, and for providing transport if they need to get to and from the facilities.\xa0they are at the coalface of this disease, and they need as much support as we can provide them. more top stories how big grocers in canada are preparing for covid-19videon.s. public sector staff, students must self-isolate for 14 days if they travel outside canadalobster buyers call for shutdown of n.s. fishery as coronavirus guts world marketsgas prices in nova scotia drop to lowest level in four yearsas deadlines loom, cermaq hasn't finalized nova scotia fish farm locations"", 'add a little green to your isolation blues by growing an indoor garden co-owner of kuhlmann\'s greenhouse garden market suggests growing an indoor oasis as a way to cope with pressures of the covid-19 pandemic.

""a fund set up by the world bank three years ago to help fight infectious diseases has done more to rack up fees for bankers and investors than it has to help doctors battle outbreaks, which is why some critics call it an expensive waste of money. between 2013 and 2016, an ebola outbreak in west africa killed more than 11,000\xa0people, a tragic reminder of just how quickly deadly diseases can spiral out of control. while there\'s still no cure for the disease, public health experts know that having adequate health care infrastructure\xa0can go a long way in keeping a lid on the spread of disease. but the cost of even\xa0basic medical equipment such as\xa0surgical masks or\xa0gloves\xa0can be prohibitively expensive for developing countries.\xa0 which is why policymakers at the world bank came up with what sounded like novel idea at the time: what if there was a way to use investors in market economics to help countries access cash to fight disease in a hurry\xa0in exchange for a reasonable return for taking on that risk? generous interest payments with that, the pandemic bond was born. in 2017, the world bank created what\'s officially known as the pandemic emergency financing facility,\xa0or pef.\xa0the idea was simple: the fund would raise hundreds of millions of dollars\xa0from investors willing to contribute to a pool of money that developing countries could tap into as needed to help fight the next pandemic. outbreaks in rich countries aren\'t covered. the bond\'s payout was targeted toward\xa0the 76 poorest countries\xa0in the world, which are members of the world banks\'s international development association, or ida. the benefit to global health seems obvious, but investors got a nice return out of the deal, too. launched in the summer of\xa02017 and set to expire in july of this year,\xa0one tranche of the fund would pay out an annual interest of 6.9 per cent above the libor rate, a\xa0benchmark interest rate set in the financial capital of london.\xa0 the other tranche was even more generous — 11.5 per cent above libor every year\xa0for three years. at the current libor rate, that means investors get a\xa0payout of more than eight and 13 per cent, respectively, if they own each tranche. but there\'s a catch, of course. investors get those interest payments annually, but if a pandemic breaks out and countries need the cash to fight disease, investors lose the principal they put in. analysisthe longer and deeper the covid-19 crisis, the harder it will be to bounce back: don pittis despite the realistic risk of losing everything, there were twice as many people wanting to buy into the offering than there was space available. demand like that suggests the market thinks the bond was a win-win.\xa0 """"we expect this concept of fighting disease and providing disaster relief to be replicated in the future', 'as governments struggle with pandemic response, political parties shift gears on fundraising a number of canada\'s federal parties say they will continue to call on their supporters\xa0for financial contributions\xa0in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic —\xa0while others are reconsidering those fundraising requests or abandoning\xa0them altogether.

""the opec oil cartel is calling for a deep production cut to keep crude prices from falling further as disruption to global business from the coronavirus slashes demand from air travel and industry. oil ministers from the 14 opec countries decided at a meeting thursday to push for a cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, or about 1.5 per cent\xa0of total world supply. it remains unclear, however, whether that can stabilize a market as demand is falling sharply because of the virus outbreak\'s impact on businesses around the world. since the outbreak began in china last month, air travel to the country — the world\'s second-largest economy — has all but stopped, sapping demand for aviation fuel. manufacturing output fell sharply as cities with millions of residents locked down to contain the spread of the virus. that has caused chaos for industries around the world, and major companies have halted business travel out of precaution. opec\'s move appears aimed at keeping prices roughly where they are by preventing a further decline. lower prices can help consumer demand, particular in the united states, by putting more cash in consumer pockets to consume other goods. they have less impact on drivers in europe, where higher taxes are the main component in fuel prices. opec nations agree to further oil supply cut us gasoline is $2.42 per gallon according to the u.s. energy information administration, little changed from a year ago. the opec proposal calls for its members to cut output by 1 million barrels a day, with another 500,000 barrels to be cut by non-member allies, like russia, who have been co-ordinating production measures with the cartel in recent years. members and non-members will meet friday to decide. russia\'s agreement is not certain, however. iranian oil minister bijan zangeneh noted that russia has been reluctant to go along with cuts. asked if opec had a plan b if russia does not go along, he replied: """"no', ' \'he also produces the cbc political podcast spin reduxit.\']"" 2020-03-25 09:00:00 the leaders of new brunswick’s three opposition parties say they’re finding a way to hold the government to account on covid-19 -- even as they are brought into the decision-making process behind closed doors.', ""cbc radio's saskatoon morning explores impact of covid-19 after 1st presumptive positive, junos cancelled cbc radio's saskatoon morning live junos program on friday morning has evolved after news of saskatchewan's first presumptive positive covid-19 case and the cancellation of the juno awards in the wake of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. tune in friday morning as the program provides analysis and reaction. saskatoon morning's junos-related program scheduled for\xa0friday morning has evolved after news of saskatchewan's first presumptive positive covid-19 case and the cancellation of the juno awards. friday's show will no longer be a public event at the bessborough hotel.\xa0 tune in friday morning as the program provides analysis and reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. join saskatoon morning\xa0weekdays from 6 to 8:30 a.m. on 94.1 fm.\xa0  listen to saskatoon morning listen to past episodes\xa0  email saskatoon morning at\xa0saskatoonmorning@cbc.ca\xa0or call\xa01-306-956-7456."", ' \'send your tips to nbinvestigates cbc.ca.\']"" 2020-03-19 10:00:00 one of two people with presumptive cases of covid-19 attended biology classes at bailey hall on wednesday, march 11, email says', 'all for nothing? covid-19 crushes dreams of quebec olympic athletes the canadian olympic committee took the lead worldwide, deciding not to send athletes to the tokyo 2020 games. across canada, athletes are lauding that decision, even while the news has left them reeling.

""economists are busy trying to calculate the potential economic toll of the coronavirus\xa0outbreak that\'s currently making its way around the world. but there\'s one marketplace that is already, quite unexpectedly, quantifying the full force\xa0of the bug: mortgages. rates for fixed- and variable-rate home loans are based on a variety of factors, but one of the biggest is the price that lenders have to pay to borrow money themselves. for fixed-rate canadian home loans, the benchmark that sets the price that consumer rates are based on is the five-year government of canada bond. investors who covet bonds like that one do so because they are perceived to be safe. investors\xa0are willing to accept the relatively meagre returns that government debt\xa0offers because it\'s better than the alternative — losing money on whatever other, riskier investment they would have had to buy instead. counterintuitively, the price of a bond and its yield move in opposite directions. so when appetite for bonds goes up, the amount they pay out goes down, because lenders don\'t have to offer quite as good a deal to find a buyer for their debt. the price of bonds tends to increase when people are feeling fearful,\xa0a situation that certainly describes the state of affairs today amid a mysterious coronavirus emanating from mainland china\xa0that has killed more than 100\xa0people and infected\xa0thousands more. canadian companies feeling the pinch as coronavirus takes toll on their business prospects that fear is prompting investors to pour money into the safety of\xa0government bonds, and all that buying is pushing down the yield on that debt. as recently as the start of the year, the yield on the five-year canadian government bond was about 1.7 per cent. this week, it dipped as low as just above 1.3. in the staid world of bonds, a 40-point drop in a relatively short period is huge, and it\'s filtering down into the mortgage market. bond yields influence loans fixed-rate loans are highly influenced by bond yields, because\xa0a\xa0mortgage lender makes money on the spread between the\xa0bond rate and what they offer to consumers. if the five-year bond yield goes up, they can\xa0just pass that cost on to consumers. if it goes down, as it is now, the lender\'s cost of borrowing goes down, so they can turn around and lower their rates for consumers to drum up new business. that\'s what seems to be happening.  fixed-rate loans are falling, according to james laird, ceo of mortgage broker canwise financial and co-founder of rate comparison website ratehub.ca. while specific rates will vary based on the borrower and what part of the country they\'re in, currently the best deal on offer for a five-year fixed loan is 2.64 per cent with a trust company\xa0and 2.74 per cent from a big bank. barely a month ago, those rates would have been roughly 10 to 20 points higher. stock markets slide as coronavirus fears spread while bond yields have fallen by about 40 basis points in that period, that means lenders so far have only passed on about a quarter of those savings to consumers. but that is likely to\xa0soon change. lenders are always slower to pass on savings than they are to pass on added costs, laird said, but they can only hold off for so long.

"" barely four months since its last budget, alberta\'s plan to balance the books is already off the rails. the province\'s upcoming budget — due next week — will face difficult choices to fill a new multibillion-dollar hole. the problem, as usual for alberta, is low oil prices. the province was previously counting on oil prices rising from $57 us\xa0per barrel in 2019/20 to $63 us\xa0by 2022/23. but after the coronavirus shocked the world\'s second-largest economy, this looks a lot less likely. oil demand in china is down by roughly 20 per cent, and global prices are down more than $10 per barrel as a result. lasting implications for global supply chains combined with trade wars, brexit fears\xa0and rising global uncertainty\xa0means low prices might continue for some time.\xa0 no one can predict the future with certainty, especially when it comes to oil prices. but the current futures market — where investors make deals for oil tomorrow, at prices agreed to today — suggests many expect oil to remain barely over over $51 per barrel for some time to come. that\'s a full $12 per barrel less than alberta\'s government was counting on.  this is going to hurt. each dollar-per-barrel drop in oil prices costs alberta\'s budget $800,000 to $900,000 per day. a weaker canadian dollar will cushion some of that blow, but not all. updating my own estimate of the provincial budget, i find that we\'re now on track for a deficit of well over $1 billion by 2022/23, instead of the planned $1.8-billion surplus.  to make matters worse, alberta\'s entire economy is slowing down. the government was hoping the economy would grow rapidly, at 2.7 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent next. today, most forecasters anticipate growth to be a full one-per-cent lower.  this also hurts the budget. and while it is hard to say precisely, this may shave a few hundred million more off government revenues and increase pressure on already strained income-support programs. tough choices ahead alberta\'s budget 2020 will have to make some tough new choices. none will be easy, and some may be unwise. the government could ignore the problem and present a budget with optimistic growth and oil price targets. this would be a big gamble, and merely paper over the problem hoping it goes away on its own. or it could distract from the real issues and shift blame to ottawa — a regular (and often successful) tactic of many alberta governments. from equalization to climate policies to pipeline delays, there\'s no shortage of potential targets to blame an enlarged deficit on. given the sudden and intense interest on the teck frontier approval and growing demands for reforms to federal transfers, the seeds may already have been planted. opinionclearing the air on teck frontier: here are the expected benefits — and harms — of the oilsands project but while we may see some of this, the province\'s commitment to balance by 2022/23 is unlikely to budge. this means further spending cuts, and (perhaps) tax increases. to their credit, the government was providing itself a reasonable cushion in the last budget — enough that it could lose almost $1.8 billion in revenue by 2022 yet still balance on time. but today\'s shock, if fully priced in, will require they find roughly $1.3 billion in new cuts. this would mean program spending would have to fall by 1.8 per cent per year over the next three years, compared to the one per cent per year the government previously planned for. this would make program spending more than\xa05.3-per-cent lower by 2022/23, compared to when they first took office, rather than the 2.8 per cent they were hoping for. while there may be some low-hanging fruit — the province\'s """"war room', ""before and after: world landmarks empty amid coronavirus closures, quarantines from mecca to wuhan to japan's disneyland, satellite photos show the impact of coronavirus closures and quarantines on some landmarks. landmark locations in saudi arabia, iran, china, italy and japan have emptied after closures and quarantines have reduced visitor traffic. these satellite images demonstrate the degree to which people have stopped congregating. mecca, saudi arabia saudi arabia\xa0hosts the two holiest sites of islam, in mecca and medina, and welcomes millions of muslim visitors throughout the year with a peak for the hajj pilgrimage. this\xa0satellite image released by maxar technologies shows a large crowd surrounding the kaaba at the grand mosque in mecca on feb.\xa014.

(data from worldometers.info/graph by steven lewis) let's look at the european extremes: italy and germany. italy has the most cases (28,000) but germany has more than 7,000 and its number is growing rapidly. yet italy's death rate so far is 35 times higher than germany's.\xa0 moreover, only two of germany's 7,200 active cases are classified as serious or critical, while in italy it's 1,850 out of 21,000. in canada there have been four deaths among 422 cases and only one of the 407 active cases is serious or critical. what's going on here? no one has a ready answer.\xa0 the health care infrastructure in italy and germany is pretty much the same. germany may be a week or two behind italy in the pandemic, but in most countries the death rates seem higher at the beginning of the upsurge because the more serious cases are likely to present and be tested first.\xa0 germany has promoted widespread testing, which is more likely to confirm non-serious cases and prevent them from coming into contact with more vulnerable groups, but so has italy. and italy took stronger measures to contain the virus than germany. death rates are much higher in the elderly — as much as 15 per cent in the 80+ age group – and italy has a relatively old population, but germany has the oldest median age in europe.\xa0 does the german gene pool create some sort of uniquely effective immune response to just this novel coronavirus? highly unlikely. is the virus somehow different in germany? virtually impossible. could german health care be that much more effective? again, no.\xa0 then what? analysiscovid-19 has arrived in saskatchewan. be prudent, but don't panic at this point the discrepancies seem both massive and unexplained. if they converge in the next few weeks we will be closer to an explanation. it may be that germany has thus far been lucky, with the exposures having\xa0occurred mainly among younger and healthier people. or maybe italy has been unlucky, with high rates of exposure in people with pre-existing health conditions that make them vulnerable.\xa0 if the perplexing differences remain after a few more weeks and tens of thousands — or millions — of new cases, we will have a barnburner of an epidemiological mystery on our hands.\xa0 the most revealing data over time will be the death rates in the oldest population groups, because the numbers are higher and the statistics will be more reliable. if these still vary hugely, a lot of analysts will be scratching a lot of heads.\xa0 where is canada headed? at this early stage, it looks more like germany than italy, but that can change quickly.\xa0 germany may not look like germany on april 1. with any luck, italy may not look quite so dire by then. to channel donald rumsfeld, there are unknown unknowns. for now, we are stuck with a paradox on either side of the alps.\xa0 what's the covid-19 death rate? i'll get back to you.  this column is part of cbc's\xa0opinion\xa0section. for more information about this section, please read this\xa0editor's blog\xa0and our\xa0faq.  read more opinion and point of view pieces from cbc saskatchewan  interested in writing for us? we accept pitches for opinion and point-of-view pieces from saskatchewan residents who want to share their thoughts on the news of the day, issues affecting their community or who have a compelling personal story to share. no need to be a professional writer! read more about what we're looking for here, then email\xa0sask-opinion-grp@cbc.ca\xa0with your idea."", 'no appetite, no smell: saskatchewan athlete recounts falling ill with covid-19 the possibility of having covid-19 started to become real for brock weston as he drove home to saskatchewan. the wisconsin college student had had fever sweats the night before. a stuffy nose and sore throat he thought were from dust in the air or maybe, at worst, a cold or flu had been hanging around for a couple of days.
